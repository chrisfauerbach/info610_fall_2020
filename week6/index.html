# Materialized Views

Materialized views in PostgreSQL use the rule system like views do, but persist the results in a table-like form. The main differences between:

```sql 
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mymatview AS SELECT * FROM mytab; ```
and:

```sql 
CREATE TABLE mytable AS SELECT * FROM mytab; 
CREATE VIEW myview AS SELECT * FROM mytab; 
```

are that the materialized view cannot subsequently be directly updated and that the query used to create the materialized view is stored in exactly the same way that a view's query is stored, so that fresh data can be generated for the materialized view with:

```sql 
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mymatview; ```


---
While access to the data stored in a materialized view is often much faster than accessing the underlying tables directly or through a view, the data is not always current; yet sometimes current data is not needed. Consider a table which records sales:

```sql 
CREATE TABLE invoice (
    invoice_no    integer        PRIMARY KEY,
    seller_no     integer,       -- ID of salesperson
    invoice_date  date,          -- date of sale
    invoice_amt   numeric(13,2)  -- amount of sale
);
```
If people want to be able to quickly graph historical sales data, they might want to summarize, and they may not care about the incomplete data for the current date:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
  SELECT
      seller_no,
      invoice_date,
      sum(invoice_amt)::numeric(13,2) as sales_amt
    FROM invoice
    WHERE invoice_date < CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY
      seller_no,
      invoice_date
    ORDER BY
      seller_no,
      invoice_date;
```
---
# Update Materialized View

This materialized view might be useful for displaying a graph in the dashboard created for salespeople. 

A job could be scheduled to update the statistics each night using this SQL statement:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```


---
# Distinct

<b>SELECT DISTINCT</b> eliminates duplicate rows from the result.

If SELECT DISTINCT is specified, all duplicate rows are removed from the result set (one row is kept from each group of duplicates)


---
# In practice

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
   id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
   bcolor VARCHAR,
   fcolor VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO t1 (bcolor, fcolor)
VALUES
   ('red', 'red'),
   ('red', 'red'),
   ('red', NULL),
   (NULL, 'red'),
   ('red', 'green'),
   ('red', 'blue'),
   ('green', 'red'),
   ('green', 'blue'),
   ('green', 'green'),
   ('blue', 'red'),
   ('blue', 'green'),
   ('blue', 'blue');

```
---

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1;
```

|ID|bcolor|fcolor|
|--|--|--|
|1|red|red|
|2|red|red|
|3|red||
|4||red|
|5|red|green|
|6|red|blue|
|7|green|red|
|8|green|blue|
|9|green|green|
|10|blue|red|
|11|blue|green|
|12|blue|blue|

---

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1;
```

|ID|bcolor|fcolor|
|--|--|--|
|1|red|red|
|2|red|red|
|3|red||
|4||red|
|5|red|green|
|6|red|blue|
|7|green|red|
|8|green|blue|
|9|green|green|
|10|blue|red|
|11|blue|green|
|12|blue|blue|


---

```sql

select distinct bcolor from t1

```

|bcolor|
|--|
|(null)|
|green|
|blue|
|red|

# WHERE clause

Chapter 5, Pg 179

* Used to filter data in a result set

* Filtering is specified after the `WHERE` keyword

* If rows MATCH the `WHERE` clause, they are returned

```sql
SELECT [COLUMNS] FROM [TABLE(s)] WHERE [CONDITION(s)]
```

e.g.

```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 4
```

---
# WHERE examples

```sql 
SELECT * FROM car_model WHERE make='Ford';

SELECT * FROM car WHERE mileage < 250000;

SELECT * FROM car WHERE number_of_doors > 3 AND number_of_owners <= 2 ;
```

Can perform math, watch out for divide by zero

```sql
SELECT * FROM t WHERE b / a > 0.5 and a<>0;
```

* <, <=, >, >=, <>
* BETWEEN ( x BETWEEN a AND b ) ( inclusive, x >= a AND x <= b )
* OVERLAPS (comparing two dates ranges)
  * (date '2018-10-25', date '2018-10-31') OVERLAPS  (date '2018-10-25', date '2018-11-15')
---

# Grouping

The GROUP BY Statement in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups with the help of some functions. i.e if a particular column has same values in different rows then it will arrange these rows in a group

*  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-group-by/

```sql
SELECT column1, function_name(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
ORDER BY column1, column2;

function_name: Name of the function used for example, SUM() , AVG().
table_name: Name of the table.
condition: Condition used.
```

# Example


|make|model|year|price|
|--|--|--|
|Ford|Flex|2012|11,234|
|Ford|Flex|2013|12,222|
|Ford|Flex|2012|14,999|
|BMW|330i|2012|17,999|
|BMW|330i|2013|18,999|
|...|...|...|...|

```sql
SELECT make, model, count(*)
FROM car_for_sale
GROUP BY make, model
```

|Make|Model|Count(*)|
|--|--|--|
|Ford|Flex|3|
|BMW|330i|7|
|Honda|Civic|9|


---
# HAVING


|make|model|year|price|
|--|--|--|
|Ford|Flex|2012|11,234|
|Ford|Flex|2013|12,222|
|Ford|Flex|2012|14,999|
|BMW|330i|2012|17,999|
|BMW|330i|2013|18,999|
|...|...|...|...|

```sql
SELECT make, model, count(*) c
FROM car_for_sale
GROUP BY make, model
HAVING  c > 7
```

|Make|Model|Count(*)|
|--|--|--|
|Honda|Civic|9|

---
# Ordering Results

`ORDER BY` clause allows for sorting of results

```sql
... ORDER BY price desc
```
```sql
... ORDER BY price asc
```

* NULL is considered great than any other value

```sql
SELECT make, model, count(*) c FROM cars GROUP BY make, model ORDER BY c desc
```
```sql
SELECT make, model, price  FROM cars  ORDER BY price asc
```

```sql
SELECT make, model, price  FROM cars  ORDER BY 1, 2, price asc
// Make, Model, Price
```



---
# INSERT

Put data into the database

```sql
INSERT INTO cars (make, model, year, price) values ('Ford','Focus', 2001,1500);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO cars (make, model, year, price) values 
   ('Ford','Focus', 2001,1500)
   ,('Honda','Civic', 2005,2250);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO expensive_cars(make, model, year, price) 
   SELECT make,  model, year, price FROM cars WHERE price > 20000;
```
---
# UPDATE

Changes data that's in the database.

```sql
UPDATE t SET f = f + 1 WHERE id = 5;
```

```sql
UPDATE t SET description = "This is a new description";
```

---
# DELETE

Permanently removes data from a database

```sql
DELETE FROM t WHERE id = 120;
```

```sql
DELETE FROM t WHERE id = 120;
```

```sql
DELETE  FROM car WHERE make = 'porsche' RETURNING *;

porsche, 911 Turbo, 2003, 23000

```



---
# TRUNCATE

Deletes ALL the data in a table, leaves the table behind.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE cars;
```

Really useful on large tables.   Same as 
```sql
DELETE FROM cars;
```
but much faster since it doesn't delete row by row.


---
# PICK A PROJECT
* Come up with a project definition.  Less than two page writeup of what will happen in your application/database
* Design database tables, ER Diagram, Relationships (one to one, one to many, many to many), name your tables
* Detail Design - All columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys
* Build SQL to generate tables
* Build SQL to insert data
* Generate SQL to query state of the database 
* Each project needs at least 10 tables.  If you can't come up with 10, then add more to your story.

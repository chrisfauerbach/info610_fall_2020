# Fun Uses of Postgresql

* Window Functions
  * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/tutorial-window.html
* JSON Intro

---
# Window Functions

* A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. 

* This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. 

* But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows retain their separate identities. 

* Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

---
# Sample Data

```sql

CREATE TABLE 
employee_salary(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, department varchar, 
employee_number int, salary int);

INSERT INTO employee_salary(department, employee_number, salary) 
VALUES
  ('develop',11,5200),
  ('develop',7,4200),
  ('develop',9,4500),
  ('develop',8,6000),
  ('develop',10,5200),
  ('personnel',5,3500),
  ('personnel',2,3900),
  ('sales',3,4800),
  ('sales',1,5000),
  ('sales',4,4800);

```

# Example (avg)
Here is an example that shows how to compare each employee's salary with the average salary in his or her department:

```sql 
SELECT department, employee_number, salary, avg(salary) 
OVER (PARTITION BY department) 
FROM employee_salary;
```


|dept|empoyee_number|salary|avg(salary)|
|--|--|--|--|
|develop|11|5200|5020.0000000000000000|
|develop|7|4200|5020.0000000000000000|
|develop|9|4500|5020.0000000000000000|
|develop|8|6000|5020.0000000000000000|
|develop|10|5200|5020.0000000000000000|
|personnel|5|3500|3700.0000000000000000|
|personnel|2|3900|3700.0000000000000000|
|sales|3|4800|4866.6666666666666667|
|sales|1|5000|4866.6666666666666667|
|sales|4|4800|4866.6666666666666667|


---
# Example (avg)
Here is an example that shows how to compare each employee's salary with the maximum salary in his or her department:

```sql
SELECT department, employee_number, salary, max(salary) 
OVER (PARTITION BY department) 
FROM employee_salary;
```


|dept|empoyee_number|salary|max(salary)|
|--|--|--|--|
|develop|11|5200|6000|
|develop|7|4200|6000|
|develop|9|4500|6000|
|develop|8|6000|6000|
|develop|10|5200|6000|
|personnel|5|3500|3900|
|personnel|2|3900|3900|
|sales|3|4800|5000|
|sales|1|5000|5000|
|sales|4|4800|5000|

# Ranking

* rank function produces a numerical rank within the current row's partition for each distinct ORDER BY value, in the order defined by the ORDER BY clause. rank needs no explicit parameter, because its behavior is entirely determined by the OVER clause
---
# Ranking (cont)
* The rows considered by a window function are those of the "virtual table" produced by the query's FROM clause as filtered by its WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses if any. 
* For example, a row removed because it does not meet the WHERE condition is not seen by any window function. 

* A query can contain multiple window functions that slice up the data in different ways by means of different OVER clauses, but they all act on the same collection of rows defined by this virtual table.

---
# Ranking

```sql
SELECT department, employee_number, salary, rank() 
OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) 
FROM employee_salary;
```

|dept|empoyee_number|salary|max(salary)|
|--|--|--|--|
|develop|8|6000|1|
|develop|10|5200|2|
|develop|11|5200|2|
|develop|9|4500|4|
|develop|7|4200|5|
|personnel|2|3900|1|
|personnel|5|3500|2|
|sales|1|5000|1|
|sales|3|4800|2|
|sales|4|4800|2|

It is also possible to omit PARTITION BY, in which case there is just one partition containing all the rows.

---
# SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_salary ORDER BY department desc, salary desc
```
|department|employee_number|salary|
|--|--|--|
|sales|1|5000 **|
|sales|4|4800|
|sales|3|4800|
|personnel|2|3900 **|
|personnel|5|3500|
|develop|8|6000 **|
|develop|11|5200|
|develop|10|5200|
|develop|9|4500|
|develop|7|4200|

---
# Window Frame

* For each row, there is a set of rows within its partition called its window frame.
* Many (but not all) window functions act only on the rows of the window frame, rather than of the whole partition. 
* By default, if ORDER BY is supplied then the frame consists of all rows from the start of the partition up through the current row, plus any following rows that are equal to the current row according to the ORDER BY clause. *
* When ORDER BY is omitted the default frame consists of all rows in the partition.

---

# No order by

```sql
SELECT salary, sum(salary) OVER () FROM employee_salary;
```

|salary|sum|
|--|--|
|5200|47100|
|4200|47100|
|4500|47100|
|6000|47100|
|5200|47100|
|3500|47100|
|3900|47100|
|4800|47100|
|5000|47100|
|4800|47100|

---
# With Order By

```sql
SELECT salary, sum(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) FROM employee_salary;
```

|salary|sum|
|--|--|
|3500|3500|
|3900|7400|
|4200|11600|
|4500|16100|
|4800|25700|
|4800|25700|
|5000|30700|
|5200|41100|
|5200|41100|
|6000|47100|

# JSON

* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

* JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data

* JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

* JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand


https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp

---
# Example

```json
{
   "employees":[
      {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
      {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
      {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
   ]
}
```

* Data is in name/value pairs
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects
* Square brackets hold arrays

---
# row_to_json

SELECT row_to_json(employee_salary) FROM employee_salary;

{"f1":9,"f2":4500}

```

```json
{"employee_number":11,"salary":5200}
{"employee_number":7,"salary":4200}
{"employee_number":9,"salary":4500}
```

# Array Aggregation

```
SELECT array_to_json(array_agg(row_to_json(t)))
    FROM (
      SELECT employee_number, salary FROM employee_salary
    ) t
```

```json

[{"employee_number":11,"salary":5200}
,{"employee_number":7,"salary":4200}
